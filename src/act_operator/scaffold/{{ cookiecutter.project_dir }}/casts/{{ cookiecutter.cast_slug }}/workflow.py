"""Entry point for the {{ cookiecutter.cast_name }} workflow.

Overview:
    * Extends :class:`BaseWorkflow` to build a LangGraph StateGraph.
    * Uses :class:`{{ cookiecutter.cast_snake | title | replace(" ", "") }}State` as the underlying state container.
    * Ships with a minimal start â†’ end path that you can extend.

Guidelines:
    1. Call ``builder.add_node()`` with custom node classes.
    2. Connect nodes via ``builder.add_edge()`` or conditional edges when branching.
    3. Return the compiled graph to orchestrate LangGraph execution.
